- how to load sagas?
- express server with hot reload and loading app for any path
- load all css preprocessors, perhaps even cssnext
- css sourcemaps
- wtf is extracttextplugin and why is everyone using it for css
	- it would seem it is used to seperate css into its own file/bundle, rather then inlining it into js
- autoprefixer (needed? read up on postcss)
- dotenv lib
- load larger libraries from cdn in production
- Consider using flow (babel-eslint might be need with that)
- prod eslint (disable console.logs, debuggers, etc.)
